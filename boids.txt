boids

current issues:
-collision avoidance works, but there's oscillation from alignment, coherence, and separation
-collision avoidance probably should be prioritized, some boids escape the cage
-coherence won't work correctly without flock functionality because boids need to access the location of all the other boids, so an owner class, flock should be implemented
-performance is quite bad at only 100 boids. this might change when you implement flock and remove the sphere perception / overlap functions

plan for features:
-cage spawning? 
-maybe you can set your parameters before executing, then do new simulations with different parameters (your simulation should at the very least work well under a variety of parameters, not one goldilocks setup that is the least buggy)
-some kind of hud that tracks things
-spawning boids with the keyboard or maybe changing parameters on the fly during execution, maybe even removing forces entirely to see changes in boid behavior

can spawn boids?
keeps list of all boids which boids must be used in a boid's steering algorithm (at least for coherence; alignment and steering work without it apparently, though the current setup is causing performance issues which might be related to the overlap functions being triggered too often)
